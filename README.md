FinViz Hyperlinks

Questions:
How many stocks do you want scraped at a time? Like the first 30? Since it refreshes, I wouldn't be able to just get each one cause they are constantly changing.

Project progression:
CHECK Get news link from one stock if it’s the same day

CHECK Get news links from all stocks if it’s the same day

CHECK Compile information into csv file

CHECK Make info append into csv file each time it runs

Extra: display current day info on webpage for easy access
